As stated in the description of the repo this is a command line interface program that webscrapes StockX, GOAT, and Stadium Goods for product information. 
I made this program to learn the fundamentals of webscraping and to familiarize myself with Python back in September 2022. 
As of January 2024, the StockX and Stadium Goods modules no longer work because the websites APIs have been updated.

To-do:
Update stockx.py & stadiumgoods.py.
Create web app GUI version.
